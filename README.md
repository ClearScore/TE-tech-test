# TE-tech-test
_The following is a draft WIP repo for the technical task that will be presented to candidates in the near future_



# ClearScore Tech Test

Congratulations on being selected to progress to the next stage of the interview process and to complete our tech test. The purpose of this test is to assess the quality of the code that you write, your approach to problem solving, and your ability to reason about the approaches and practices you have implemented.

There isn't necessarily a _correct_ or _perfect_ submission for this task, different approaches have various benefits and downsides, however you will be expected to defend your decisions if you are asked to attend a face-to-face interview.

In the same vein, do not worry too much about how much progress you make through each section, but rather **make sure that what you _do_ complete is of a high, production-ready standard**. 

This is not a "timed-task", but anything you don't prioritise to complete should be mentioned in the README.md .

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us.

**Designers comments:**

> The 'drawer' UI is still being worked on, sorry! Please don't spend any time on the look and feel.
>
> The features are good to go though. We should show/hide the insight description with an 'on/off track' tag, the title and relevant description along with the additional information.

# What to focus on

- Your critical thinking and testing approach
- Your ability to evaluate Tests (Or as we call it - Quality Assistance)
- Having a testing mindset
- Scalable / maintainable code

Good luck!
